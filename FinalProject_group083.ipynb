Our goal is to take these different factors into consideration when performing our analysis.\n",

    "Utilizing two datasets provided by CHR and CDC, we sought to answer our question of how residing in various populations have an effect on various health conditions and mortality rates for individuals within those populations. Our initial hypothesis was that individuals living in larger populations would have poorer health and mortality than those living in rural populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis, we separated the populations into three subsets; the first subset being the largest populations, second being medium populations, and last being small populations. The first variable we analyzed was the \"Poor or fair raw health value.\" Contrary to our hypothesis, rural counties reported higher quantities of population in poor or fair health over their large metropolitan counterparts. This is also the same for average life expectancy, however. Large metropolitan counties report similar, but slightly longer life expectancy than rural counties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diving deeper into our analysis, we decided to take additional health indicators into account, such as infant mortality, diabetes, and HIV prevalence. Furthermore, we wanted to see if racial distribution within the various populations had any relation to the variables in our analysis. We found that rural counties are afflicted by higher rates of diabetes and infant mortality, while the largest metropolitan counties have substantially higher rates of HIV prevalence. While much of our analysis found poorer and poorer health conditions the more rural a county was, HIV prelance is a notable exception, likely due to high-risk behaviors like unprotected sex and intravanous drug-use, and is an issue most-notably seen in the largest of cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis concludes that larger metropolitan populations are generally healthier than rural populations, with the exception of HIV prevalence. We used corrolation functions to find that the indicators of smoking, mental distress, obesity, insufficient sleep, and being uninsured serve as indicators for decreased self-reported health and life expectancy. Unfortunately, we cannot create a casual relationship between any of these variables.In order to explain the causes for these differences, we would need to perform a much more expansive study with access to a lot more variables in datasets pertaining to healthcare infastructure which are much less readily available then those concerning public health. While this can come from lobbing by large pharmaceutical instutions, it is also a result of the need for privacy for the sensitive nature of this data. It would be far more worrisome if the type of data we would need for extensive studies was made public in the same way census data is at it would raise serious ethical and privacy concerns pertaining users health. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypothesis was clearly wrong, however it was done before both conducting our own study/reading other studies and created under the belief that the artificial enviroment cities provide would  caused decreased health conditions in people compared to the romanticized view of living away from people and much closer to nature. While we cannot point to the specific elements that cause the health decline, what we can derive from our analysis is that there are clear differences between health indicators between urban and rural populations. We hope that our research brings attention to this so we can eliminate this disparity, because all Americans should have the opportunity for equal health regardless of where they reside."
